# concept_demos
Short snippets of code that demonstrate some feature, concept, or behavior of that programming language

Right now these are fairly terse. As times goes on, I'd like to add more descriptions of what is being demonstrated.
A good example of what I hope to achieve is concept_demos/python/demo_Decimal_rounding.py
